                Elissa Burnley, an orphan who climbed up from the dirt and grime of The Illinoi Slums for a desperate
                chance at survival... or perhaps to even thrive in the overly saturated city of Illinoi, one of the
                busiest trading hubs in the galaxy located on Planet Astuargo. Most of its popularity is attributed to
                the fact that Astuargo is located near a heavily used jump gate under the absolute control of the
                Galactic Empire effectively declaring the planet as a natural stop for all kinds of cargo vessels and
                opportunists alike much like the fellow smugglers of Illinoi who saw it as heaven for business.
                There wasn't a better place than Astuargo to have your goods smuggled across the Jump Gates right
                under the nose of those Galactic stooges, bribing local cargo vessels, transporting the goods personally
                with the help of all the nifty people under their pockets, it was all too damn common. The authorities
                however were either too full of it to admit it or preferred letting it pass as long as it gave them an
                account full of credits.<br><br>

                You were either born rich or you could hope to be if you were lucky enough to be brought into an average
                earning household. For the other not so fortunate souls of Illinoi however there wasn't much to choose
                from, you were either one of the millions left homeless barely scratching by to make a living or
                fortunate enough to have a roof above your head but not so fortunate to have the ability to think more
                than what today's meal would be. Healthcare, Education? that was a rare commodity left to ones who could
                afford avoiding the filth that were the Slums of Illinoi. The governments tall claims of eradicating
                poverty and providing equal opportunity for the citizens still fails to be seen, Until that happens
                however the underworld of Illinoi will continue to provide ample opportunity for the ones daring enough
                to go against the Empire strict laws against criminals.<br><br>

                Smuggling, not just in Illinoi but in most of the galaxy was one of the most profitable business's,
                perhaps not a business in the eyes of the Empire but one without a ceiling regardless. If you knew your
                way around people and most importantly jump gates you'd be set for a couple thousand credits for
                just a single contract. The ones who really stood out from the rest could navigate Tangle wormholes
                which required serious skill and a tad bit of crazy the benefit of avoiding the Empires check posts
                however was well worth the risks.<br><br>

                At the age of 15 Elissa like many others looked to Harold Stoff for work, a smuggler in charge of
                Illinoi's most notorious smuggling group. Taking in orphans off the street in the hopes of raising them
                for small time smuggling operations in Illinoi was a common practice for Stoff, for the kids it meant
                having a roof to sleep under and the kinda food they could only peer at beforehand and a decent sum of
                credits far better than what the government had ever offered. All they had to do was help transport the
                goods from point A to B in Illinoi for them to smuggled abroad.<br><br>

                Elissa stood out from the rest, quickly learning her way all around Illinoi even avoiding the Imperial
                check-post's landed her a position in Stoff's off-planet smuggling operations. Her position was further
                solidified the day a crew of one of Stoff's ships discovered her ability to navigate through Tangle's
                effortlessly a rare ability Informally known as wormhole-sight. This made her central to many of
                Stoff's smuggling contracts leaving other smugglers dreaming of buying her for themselves.<br><br>

                Years of working under the boot of Stoff and getting paid shit compared to what the man earned despite
                all the field work coming from Elissa and the rest was started to get tiresome. She was the one that
                made it possible for him to navigate his ships through tangles, it beckoned the question... why work
                with Stoff? a ship of her own and a skilled pilot would be the stepping stone to fill a void. Smuggling
                cargo in the sole possession of the Empire was in huge demand by its enemies.<br><br>

                There was an unspoken rule as far as smuggling was concerned. To not interfere with the Galactic Empires
                shipment in 'any' case and to not smuggle cargo under the strict possession of the empire. The
                consequences for such a crime? a life long imprisonment in one of the empires congested prisons to live
                the rest of your mining and playing Russian roulette with frostbite or to play host to a Rra'ama
                symbiont, most would prefer a death sentence over that but the Empire saw death as a frail punishment
                and besides spacewasn't an issue when you have a whole planet to yourself.<br><br>

                The ramifications didn't bother Elissa the way she saw it, the Empire would never know if the shipments
                were through a tangle they couldn't possibly know... only thing was, Harold Stoff's the kinda guy that
                likes keeping his employee's on a tight leash. The kinda guy that'd throw you out of an airlock
                because you thought about double-crossing him.<br><br>

                Fear wasn't something Elissa acknowledged not as much as she should've, being born in it must've played
                a part. The fear of dying piss poor in the Slums, the fear of not ever achieving any success in life. It
                didn't matter anyway, she had already stepped into a world filled with risks around every corner. After
                years of working together and months of convincing Elissa managed to gather a crew of four that had
                grown tired of Stoff's petty work ethics.<br><br>

                The contract was simple, ship the stolen Galactic cargo through a tangle off planet to a cargo ship in
                wait for their arrival on the other side of it. In return they were to be payed a handsome sum. Didn't
                matter what was to be smuggled nor was it there place to ask. The guarantee of the Empire not tracing it
                back to them justified the hefty paycheck. Only problem with business in Illinoi however is that words
                find their way around the place among other's in the trade. There's nothing like a pardon from Stoff
                before he puts a bullet through your only kid coupled with being thrown at the Empire afterwards that
                nullifies even the biggest paycheck. Of course that was only a pardon for one outta four but whats a
                ship without its pilot?<br><br>
