            <p>Before i start i'd like to say i hope everyone is having a good day at GP and otherwise and i believe we
                can make it better if anything in my thread interests you ^^<br><br>

                I consider myself fairly new to writing in general perhaps not so much in role playing as i've dabbled
                in it verbally as a child if that counts ^^ but as a writer
                im learning better ways to express myself and i feel like i improve with every plot i write or every
                reply i follow up with.<br><br>

                Over the time i've found out that i prefer playing female characters over male characters in RP's as
                that is what really allows my creativity to flow,
                that is not to say however that i don't play male characters i certainly do! but as of now i have way
                more plots where the main character is a female
                than a male that's only the case for my own plots however im more up for developing one with an
                interested partner and what gender i play wouldn't be an issue there.</p>

                <h2>Preferences & Expectations</h2><br>

                <p>Time & Frequency of replies - This is where i do not have any specific expectations from my partner all
                i ask is that they reply whether its once a week or once a day, just let me know if you feel like the RP
                wont work don't keep me hanging! ^^ as far as what you can expect from me in terms of replies i usually
                write back once a day or once every other day however it is entirely dependent on my real life schedule
                so at times it could be even longer or even faster but i.ll always make sure to let you know whichever
                is the case.<br><br>

                General expectations from my partner - The single most important i ask of you is to be involved in the
                story we play whether its one of my plots or your's or one we build together i want you to try to be as
                creative and interactive in the RP as i would be. By that i mean i would prefer a reply that gives me
                more than just answering my previous reply, it gives me something new to build on so it makes it easier
                for me to progress the story in my next reply. In simple terms add your own plot twists! they are fun
                and move the story along just as you would expect me to do so i'd expect the same from you so don't be
                shy to step out of the line and add what you like simply because its "my plot" i.ll let you know if it
                doesn't work but you shouldn't be worried otherwise! ^^ <br><br>

                All in all i am looking more for a partner that's interested in storytelling then just a plot that leads
                to some smut scene there will be stories where our characters might not even meet for a fair amount of
                time and as such it would be extremely important for you to pour in your creativity to bring your side
                of the story to life while i bring mine to life if that makes sense? i hope it does!. I aim to create a
                story with you that is memorable one that you have poured your heart into. It can indeed contain mature
                theme's but it won't ever really be the main focus of it unless explicitly stated. </p>

                <h2>Favorite RP Genre's & Interests</h2><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Historical plots</li>
                    <li>Sci-fi/Cyberpunk themed plots</li>
                    <li>Fantasy (Any type really)</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <p>I don't really write down pairings or to say what kind of characters/plots i prefer before reading about
                them myself simply because i don't have any i decide based on what it is that im reading and my mood at
                the time, if you're interested shoot me your idea/plot and if i like it i.ll be up for it regardless of
                the pairings etc etc... and you can use my plots below as a written example of what i prefer and what my
                writing style is like if you like what you read hit me up!

                One more little thing, if you do intend to do an RP with me with a plot of your own choosing then please
                do take the time to write out an introduction for the plot, i don't mean to sound offensive here at all
                please do not take it that way! but it just makes it easier for me to see what i like and what i would
                want to add etc.. into it.

                As far as fandom's go i don't prefer doing them, i've tried and i can never really do justice to it nor
                does my creativity flow for it so i tend to stay away from those. With that said there are four video
                game fandoms i am up for, purely because of their RPG nature with the requirement that it has to be
                consisted of original characters set in the universe of these.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Dragon age</li>
                    <li>The Elder scrolls</li>
                    <li>Fallout</li>
                    <li>Mass Effect</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Long Term Plots</h2> <br>

                <p>This will be updated as i think of new plots and such. Most of the plots however will have a central
                story line with a detailed explanation of the character i.ll be playing as, i leave most of what your
                character will be/do in the story to you as my partner that's where we both discuss and work out the
                best way to seamlessly fit your character into the world while the plots are written by me i want you to
                feel part of it and you'll have as much as i do to discuss the story and to propose an changes etc etc..
                you have in mind.

                What you play as in all of these plots is up for discussion based on what you feel is the most
                comfortable, we can both decide on what the best role would be and how to assimilate it into the plot
                seamlessly.

                I take a good amount of time and effort into this plots and the thread itself even though this is
                amateur writing i'd be really grateful if you just leave a comment if you liked what you read and it
                made your day even the slightest better it would mean the day for me! ^^ and ofc the plots are
                susceptible to ill information or plot holes since I've written these as I've gotten the creativity for
                them without any prior preparation put into them ^^
